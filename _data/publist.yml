      image: SFpub.png
      description: We succeeded in measuring the superfluid density with atomic resolution on an unconventional superconductor! In contrast to expectations for conventional superconductors, we find that the superfluid densisty is strongly inhomogeneous in FeTe0.55Se0.45.

    - title: "Amplifier for scanning tunneling microscopy at MHz frequencies"
      image: Fano.png
      description: We develop, build and test a novel amplifier circuit capable of measuring the tunneling current in the MHz regime while simultaneously performing conventional STM measurements. We are looking forward to performing scanning noise spectroscopy on quantum materials!
